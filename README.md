# Description
This simple code is a simple game of tic-tac-toe, human vs. human, for the first practical exam in Python Introduction.

The idea was to table little cels in a board and to fill then checking the users input with an if statement.

It could be a lot better, but it was my first ever Python project, so I chose to leave it here as is.

I was really proud are how it turned out.


I translated all the comments, but left the variable names as they were.

# How to play
To input a move, you use something akin to chess notation.
First your piece, then the space you want to move to.

For exemple, the X player wants to mark the middle space: "XB2"
